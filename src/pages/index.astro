      <p>
        Welcome to my personal blog! My goal with this site, is to give my
        opinion on the stuff I work on and I learn about. I hope you find it
        useful and interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        My personal goals are mainly around Rust and Zig this days since I
        already write way too much Yaml on my job... but who nows! I'm also
        interested on Linux, and the tooling around it. And of course as a good
        millenial, my goal for this year is also to ditch VSCode and start using
        Neovim serously. This whole site has been written from Neovim!
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can see from the footer, this site has been written using Astro
        and Tailwind. Hopefully what you will see is a fast static site with
        zero JS even when I'm not a web developer or UI Designer.
      </p>
